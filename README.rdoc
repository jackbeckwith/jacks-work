Link to my Heroku page: http://thawing-temple-3343.herokuapp.com/

This week I added a Heroku Addon to my app - SendGrid. Now when a user uploads a new song, he receives an email confirming that the track was saved. The email also contains a link which, when clicked, routes the user to the song's page with all its details. I plan to also implement another AddOn called PandaStream, in order to enable users to upload videos to their account.

I struggled slightly making the link work that takes the user from the confirmation email to the new song page. I talked to Jenny, and she suggested that I distance the period from the link by one space. That seemed to solve things.
