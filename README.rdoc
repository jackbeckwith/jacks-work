I've decided to pursue an app that will allow rappers and producers to connect on a social media type site. As a first step I created two tables - one for users and the other for the songs they will upload. I used a one-to-many structure, i.e. a given user can upload as many songs as they wish. To that end, I associated each song with a particular user by using "belong_to," just as Jenny did in class. For now I just have four ugly links on my home page and some remnants of HW #2 where we recreated Google's search page. As time progresses I'll add iterations and prettier styling. 

I didn't have too many problems with this one. A few styling errors - like when I omitted the <%end%> on both of my view/index pages - stumped me for a while, but things worked out fine. Looking forward to hammering out the details of my app in the coming weeks!
