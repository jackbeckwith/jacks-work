This week I added the devise gem to my application and some interesting functionality. I now have a Login/Logout link in the corner of my toolbar, which changes depending on whether a user is currently signed-in. My sign-in page is altered and now includes a "Password Confirmation" box, along with additional links to "Sign in" for existing users and "Forgot Password" which links to a new page. My password fields are now also hidden. I've also prevented a user from uploading a song without signing in. The app is definitely coming along! Over spring break I plan to add some more gems just for fun.

I struggled slightly when attaching devise to my users. I eventually realized that I was given repeated errors on the command line because my migrations were out of order. Once I switched the order of "add_devise_to_users" and "remove_email_from_users" by altering their timestamps, it all worked well.
