I encountered a few problems during homework #1. I got stuck for a little bit when dealing with SSH Keys. Once Jenny gave me some guidance, I was able to generate a new key on my local machine and record it on my GitHub account. I then used the command heroku keys:add to link the new key to my Heroku account.

I also struggled somewhat when I was trying to switch from running sqlite to postgresql for Heroku's purposes.I tried at first to adjust it from the command line, not realizing that I had to change the "Gemfile." Once I downloaded Sublime Text 2 and opened the file however, the editing was a quick copy and paste from the PowerPoint.
