This week I put in a lot of work on my app. First, I altered the songs table so that a new column, "audio," would be stored with each new song created. This "audio" attribute corresponds to the actual mp3 file associated with the song. Now when you click on the "Upload Song" tab, you'll notice that there's a spot to attach a file. I implemented that feature by using Ruby's paperclip gem and adding a file_field to the form for creating/editing songs. Pretty cool huh? Next step is to build a playback feature, but for now I'm only able to store mp3's with my app.

Next I built out the "following" feature, so that users can highlight other users that they find particularly interesting. They now receive an email when anybody starts following them. The long-term goal is to add to the users table, such that I gather more information on them that can be used in "recommending" who to follow. That will be rolled out in the next few weeks.

For the homework this week, I added the following five queries:
3 .where()'s, 1 .order(), and 1 .limit(). The first .where() appears in app/views/users/index as a .where() query to determine whether a user has already started following another user. If so, the query doesn't present the user with the option to follow them again. The next query in the show function of the user controller, which shows only the songs attributed to a particular user. The last three queries were used to order the appearance of songs on a user's dashboard, to ensure that the first 5 songs from all followees are included.
