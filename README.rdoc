This week I added to the functionality of my Music app. I wrote show, edit and destroy functions for both my user and song objects. The index page is no longer simply an archive of all users/songs created on the site. From each index page, you can look at the particulars of a given user or song, edit an object's info, or destroy it entirely. I have yet to start styling the app (two midterms last week!) but I intend to begin the process this week.

I only encountered one real issue on this assignment. I followed Jenny's instruction PDF when writing my show, edit, and destroy functions, but still found that none of the links were working. Finally I figured out that my problem lay in the fact that I had written the new functions below my user_params and song_params functions from last week - both of which were defined as "private." The private tag was applying to my show, edit, and delete functions as well. When I rearranged the order in which my functions appeared, everything worked properly.
