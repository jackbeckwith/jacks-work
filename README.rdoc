This week I added search functionality to my app. Along the nav-bar you'll notice a search box that can comb through my database in search of the submitted term(s). You can specifically search through song title's, genres, user's names and emails by using the dropdown menu at the right. Along the bottom, there are also links that bring you immediately to a genre-specific list of songs.

I tried for a very long time to ge my JavaScript working, but it still has its glitches. I've implemented song functionality along the nav-bar such that the links change color and increase in font size when hovered over. Ulimately I'd like to use jQuery to add more features to the footer, such that when a specific genre is clicked, there is a border added around the given link. That is a project for the week to come.
