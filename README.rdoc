This week I add 4 validations to my app. When a user signs up or edits his existing info, my app now ensures that the user provides a name (using the the presence validation) and a password that includes at least one digit (with the format validation). I also implemented two validations on the songs attributed to each user. I added a maximum length limit to the name of a given song (via the length validation) and ensured a genre was specified for each song with the presence validation. 

I tried styling my own error messages for each of the validations but ran into some trouble. I followed advice posted on StackOverflow but continued to have problems in the local version of my app, repeatedly getting a "MessageValidator" error. I think these issues were caused by the fact that we implemented the devise gem last week but I'm still not 100% sure. In any case, I reverted back to the preset error messages to avoid any trouble.
